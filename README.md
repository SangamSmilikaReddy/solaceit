## Overview
A significant challenge that patients face in healthcare today is the lack of awareness of their mental health. People experiencing anxiety, mood disorders, and passive depression need someone to let out their feelings while not feeling insecure about it.  While most of these disorders are treated primarily through medications, guided motivation has also proved effective for the same cause. <br/>
Thus, we developed a mental health record (MHR) website titled “soLACE it” that can be used by people who are willing to listen to a fellow person's struggle and also by people who want to speak their mind out to someone. It has two categories: Speaker and Listener. <br/>
We do not encourage our listeners to give professional advice to the speakers, and they are clearly guided through a manual on how to handle them during a session. We make sure there's a safe environment for the speaker to open up about their issues and feel heard. <br/>
